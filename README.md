# Three.js Seed and Selena Solar System

#### https://jginsburgn.github.io/threejs-seed/

This project is intended to be a quick seed for Three.js projects.

## How to Run It?

Fire up a web server and point its document root to the directory containing `index.html`. Navigate with a browser to the web server host and see magic!

## How to use it?

You can really just use it out of the box. Maybe create your own object classes like `Astro`. It is important to consider that the perspective camera has been approximated to reality, considering a person sitting in front of his computer screen and that **spacial dimensions are in meters**.
